##### One more thing #####

Pragmatic.ly team is a open team.

We'd love to share our experience and knowledge to the community, not only giving presentation, making screencasts, but also contributing to open source software.

RubyConf China is just beginning, hope we can meet in more conferences around the world next time.

See you. :)
