Today, we're excited to announce the beta version of [Fengche.co](https://fengcheco.com "Lean Collaborative Product Management Tool"), our new product to simplify the project management process.

Fengche.co is a fast and easy to use project management tool featuring real time collaboration. For years of developing products, we have tried many different project management tools. However, as a small team(<= 10), we found that most of them are too complex to do lots of work about work and most of them don't care about communication, histories which force us to use different tools for same purpose. We're always imaging there will be a tool which will make the team focus on the work with maximum productivity. That's why we created Pragmatic.ly.

Our vision for project management is a tool where you can plan, work, communicate and review in one place with great user experience. Below are some features of Fengche.co we want to share with you.

* **Single Page Interface** - Everything related to your project, including iterations, tickets, comments, are well organzied in one page. No anonying page loading, fast transition, the fluid experience of desktop app are bringing to web now. It’s clean, simple, easy and fast.
* **Real Time Collaboration** - Open the page and then you're set, no reloading required. All the updates and actions related to the project such as iterations, tickets, comments will automatically shown to you in real time to keep everyone in the same page.
* **Notifications and Activity Feed** - Miss the activities while offline? It's ok and you're easy to catch up here. The in-page notifications will let you quickly browse what happened in the project when you're away and the activity feed will let you quickly catch up what happened in an iteration and ticket.
* **Easy and Efficient Management** - The management about project is effortless and painless here to let you just focus on what matters. Stop wasting time to do 'work about work' and instead work on the project itself!
