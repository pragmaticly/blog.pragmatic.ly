Last week was a big milestone for us. After a two month private beta period we publicly launched [Pragmatic.ly](https://pragmatic.ly "Lean Collaborative Project Management Tool"). Many thanks to our private beta users for their encouraging words and kind feedback which we used to improve Pragmatic.ly. Our users are always extremely important to us.

<blockquote>
  <p>Pragmatic.ly is an elegant project management tool. It provides us just enough features for using with a very concise and clear interface, and makes project management more enjoyable.<p>
    - Yuanyi Zhang, Co-founder of <a href="http://mockingbot.com">MockingBot.com</a>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the first time that I don't end up using excel spreadsheet for doing tasks management.</p>
  - Marc-Alexandre Cartiant, project manager
</blockquote>

We shared the launch news through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, HackerNews, IRC, etc. Thanks to all the new users giving their feedback. All are highly appreciated!

Something we're hearing in the feedback is that Pragmatic.ly is a "ripoff of Asana". We even appreciate this kind of feedback and still want to thank those people for visiting our site and spending some time trying out our product. Asana definitely is a genius product and an awesome service for group collaboration. We recommend the service to our friends a lot when they need a general task management tool. We love Asana when we saw it at first glance! If you need a general shared task list for your team, give [Asana](http://asana.com) a try and you'll love it too.

But back to Pragmatic.ly - we were inspired by Asana but found it didn't work well for us in the software project management field. Shared task list is not such productive espeically for small agile teams. Developers need more! But on flip side, most of the project management services built for developers looks old and complex. We wanted to build a simple, modern tool that would make project management blissful for our developers.

Keeping simplicity in mind, we started from scratch. Following the tips from "[Bootstrapping Design](http://bootstrappingdesign.com/)", using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Spine.JS](http://spinejs.com/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), we finally created a pragmatic way for you to manage your software projects. It's a learning process from Asana and we stood on the shoulders of giants, but it's definitely not a ripoff.

[Pragmatic.ly](https://pragmatic.ly/) is still under heavy development and we'll continue adding more value to it, such as git integration, project analytics, command line tools, etc.
