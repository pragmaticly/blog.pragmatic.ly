### Background of 'Archive Iteration' function ###

We have released the 'Archive Iteration' feature for some time.  This is a very useful feature if you use iterations the way like us. We create individual iteration for each week, and put the things we will work on in the corresponding iteration.

But with time growing, the Iteration List becomes longer and longer. And most cases the old iterations are not important any more and no need always display them in the Iteration list, that's why 'Archive Iteration' feature born.

### How to archive Iteration ###

First you just need click the iteration name which you want to archive on the left sidebar.

Then click the toothed icon at the right sidebar and you will see the 'Archive' button. After clicking it, this iteration with  tickets in it will all be archived. A archived iteration with its tickets will all be hidden from your work space by default for reducing the interference to your current work.

### How to unarchive ###

By default the archived iterations will be hidden. To bring them  back to your work space you just need click the toothed icon at the bottom of the left sidebar. Then click the 'Show Archived Iterations' item.

Then you will see the archived iterations back to your Iteration List.

You can do what you want like a normal iterations to them.

The only thing you might need care about is that when tickets move into an archived iteration they will be marked as archived. In a similar way when you move the tickets out of archived iteration, they will be marked as unarchived.

If you want totally unarchive a whole iteration with its tickets. Just simply click the 'Unarchive' like before at the right sidebar after selecting a iteration.
