Now you can upload your avatar in Pragmati.ly without using [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/).
You need just simply upload it from your profile setting page.

Don't worry, by default we will still use the avatar from your Gravatar account like before if you don't upload a avatar.

### Why not this feature included in first day? 
You may ask why such a simple feature was not added in the first release day of Pragmatic.ly.

Here is the sotry, when we developing the Pragmatic.ly. We fully
focused on the core value of Pragmatic.ly part at the beginning. We
didn't want to waste even a little time on the dispensable stuff.

Yes, you are right. We had a assumption that using Gravatar is good enough
for our users.

In fact, it was really enough for our users' needs until rencently
the Pragmatic.ly user base becoming larger and larger.
Some users began asking us how to change the avatar, especially some nontechnical users.

It means that our assumption is wrong, at least for now, it's wrong. 
So what? Not a big deal, we just added this feature in very short time
and launched it.

### Our experience
1. Focus on the core value of your product at the beginning, anything
   else is secondary.
2. Don't afriad to make assumption, but don't forget testing your assumption in the real world.
3. Keep rocking... :D
