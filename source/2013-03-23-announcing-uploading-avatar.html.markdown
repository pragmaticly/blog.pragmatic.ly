Today, we have released a minor update to our users which is you can upload your image and set as your profile picture in
[Pragmatic.ly](http://pragmatic.ly "Lean Collaborative Project Management Tool and Online Collaboration")
instead of using [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/).

The UX is very simple.

### Why is such a simple feature not included from the first day?

You may have the question. We too! We spent some time debating whether we should include that before the public release. The
goal of Pragmatic.ly is to provide the simplest and elegant project management experience to help you make better products easier.
So we spent most of the time to achieve the goal and regarding to the profile picture part, we just integrated the Gravatar, the
globally recognized avatars, in one hour.

Gravatr works perfectly and we enjoy the benifits very much! Even big services like [GitHub](http://github.com) has only the Gravatar support till today.

However, when Pragmatic.ly grows, we learn a lot from our users. There are two main problems we heard with Gravatar.

READMORE

* Many users use the company email adress instead of personal to register on Pragmatic.ly and they don't and won't set an avatar on Gravatar.
* We're a team in China and lots of our users are chineses too. Gravatar is not widely used here.

We found that a real avatar can improve the team's collaboration and productivity. Yes, it's true, :). So we think it's the time to change now. It only
took us few days to release it but we're glad that we're focusing on the core value and only doing those low priority features when user really needs that.

If you haven't set your profile picture up on Pragmatic.ly yet, you should do it now. Enjoy!
